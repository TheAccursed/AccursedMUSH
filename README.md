# The Accursed MUD
The Accursed MUD is a dark fantasy action RPG MUD set in an original world. Exciting and involved gameplay is our main priority.

See our website at [www.the-accursed.com](www.the-accursed.com) for more details.

Our game offers:
1. Intense boss battles: either single player vs. boss or group vs. boss
2. A wide and diverse world: explore an extensive living world, full of secrets to uncover
3. Dungeons: [todo]
4. World events: complete world events either alone or with others
5. Questing: complete an involved primary story questline while you discover countless other hidden side quests along the way
   - A built-in 'journal' helps guide you as you complete quest tasks
   - 
7. Many tactics (classes) that each play completely differently from each other
   - Each character can unlock as many tactics as they like, although they can only use one at a time 
  
10. No syntax hunting: 


# Accursed MUSHclient Package
Welcome, Accursed, to the repository for our game's custom MUSHclient package. This stand-alone installation of MUSHclient comes bundled with capture windows and tools ensure you'll spend your time fighting enemies, not your client.

## Installing our MUSHclient Package
1. Download the .zip file from [this link]. Extract this zip to a standard directory that has read and write properties (not in "Program Files", not in "C:\", etc).
2. To start the client, run the "MUSHclient.exe" file within the unzipped folder.

## Thank Yous and Acknowledgements
Thank you to all of the people who have helped to develop and build the Accursed MUD, parts of this MUSHclient package, our website, and generally anyone else who helps to support our hobby.

A very special thank you to the originator of MUSHclient, Nick Gammon, for all of his work over the decades. Another special thanks to Avi Kelman (Fiendish) for his years-long commitment to the Aardwolf MUSHclient package, from which this was derived. Details on the licenses for both MUSHclient and Avi's work can be found in the 'COPYING' file in this repository.
